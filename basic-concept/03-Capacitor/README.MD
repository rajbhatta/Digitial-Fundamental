# What is capacitor #
- A capacitor is a device that stores electrical energy in an electric field. It consists of at least two electrical conductors separated by a distance.
- The space between capacitors may simply be a vacuum, and, in that case, a capacitor is then known as a “vacuum capacitor.” However, the space is usually filled with an insulating material known as a dielectric.

- Most of the time, a dielectric is used between the two plates. When battery terminals are connected to an initially uncharged capacitor, the battery potential moves a small amount of charge of magnitude Q from the positive plate to the negative plate. The capacitor remains neutral overall, but with charges +Q and -Q residing on opposite plates.

- The <b>capacitance </b> C of a capacitor is defined as the ratio of the maximum charge Q that can be stored in a capacitor to the applied voltage V across its plates.

C = Q/V

- where Q is maximum charge that can be stored in a capacitor
-  V is applied voltage across plate
