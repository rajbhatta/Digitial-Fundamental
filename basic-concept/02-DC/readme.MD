# 1. What is DC currents ? #
- DC stands for direct current.

# 2. How sine wave behaves in DC circuit? #

- 0 to 10 represents the positive region
- 10 to 20 represents the negative region.
- Thus negative region is missing for DC current because it doesn't changes polarity (positive to negative and negative to positive) over the time.
- The positive region is up and down because voltage can vary even in DC current.
- Normally voltage in DC circuit is constant throught the circuit.
